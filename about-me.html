					<h2>About me</h2>
					<p>
						From an Irish family, raised in Hong Kong, I feel curious about the world and want to learn about everything in it.<br><br>When I was young I was always taking things apart. If the DVD player was broken, rather than buying a new one, I would strip it, find what was wrong, and see if I could fix it.<br><br>When it was time to choose a degree, I wanted to choose something where I could pursue this interest in how things worked.<br><br>I chose Mechanical Engineering at Nottingham, where I was lucky enough to experiment with different technologies and was able to create some exciting projects.<br><br>I want to be able to apply my interests in a role for a project where I can help make a difference to society.
