		<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
		<p>
			I’m passionate about innovation and technology and how they can be used to service society. I have an innate curiosity whereby I want to understand how things work and why, and love thinking of ways in which I can improve them. I am looking to apply this to a user-conscious business with a mission I believe in.
